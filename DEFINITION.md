## Abstract

This document defines the **Fusion Framing Protocol (FFP)**, a compact and extensible binary framing mechanism for network message exchange. FFP provides a standardized method to encapsulate and transport text, binary, and control messages between peers. It is designed for simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility, making it suitable for use in both client–server and peer-to-peer applications.

## 1. Introduction

The **Fusion Framing Protocol (FFP)** defines a binary message framing system intended to provide a reliable and efficient encapsulation mechanism over an established transport connection.
FFP supports the exchange of **UTF-8 text**, **arbitrary binary**, and **control** messages, making it applicable to a wide range of networking use cases.

This specification defines the frame layout, frame types, message semantics, and security considerations necessary for correct implementation.

FFP is transport-agnostic; it can operate over any reliable, ordered byte stream transport such as TCP or TLS.

---

## 2. Terminology

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

---

## 3. Protocol Overview

FFP operates by segmenting application data into discrete **frames**, each consisting of a **header** and an associated **payload**.
The header specifies the frame’s **type** and **length**, allowing endpoints to interpret the data appropriately.

Three primary frame types are defined:

1. **Text Frames (opcode 0x1):** carry UTF-8 encoded textual data.
2. **Binary Frames (opcode 0x2):** carry opaque binary data.
3. **Control Frames (opcode 0x3):** carry protocol-level signaling information.

Control frames enable connection management, such as ping/pong keep-alive signaling or flow control.

## 4. Frame Structure

### 4.1 Frame Format

Each frame consists of a fixed-length header followed by a variable-length payload.

```text
 Protocol Structure
+--------+---------+-------------+
| 0      | 1 2 3 4 | 5 6 7 8 9 N |
+--------+---------+-------------+
| Opcode | Length  |   Payload   |
| [0x1]  | [0x4]   |   [...]     |
|        |         |             |
+--------+---------+- - - - - - -+
```

**Fields:**

- **Opcode (1 byte):**
  Identifies the frame type. Values are assigned as follows:
  - `0x0`: Reserved Frame (unused)
  - `0x1`: Text Frame
  - `0x2`: Binary Frame
  - `0x3`: Control Frame

- **Length (4 bytes):**
  Specifies the total length of the frame, including both header and payload, expressed in network byte order (big-endian).

- **Payload (variable):**
  The message content appropriate to the frame type.

---

### 4.2 Frame Types

FFP defines the following frame types:

- **Text Frame (Opcode 0x1):**
  The payload contains UTF-8 encoded text data. Endpoints **MUST** validate UTF-8 encoding before processing.

- **Binary Frame (Opcode 0x2):**
  The payload contains arbitrary binary data. The interpretation of the data is application-defined.

- **Control Frame (Opcode 0x3):**
  The payload carries control information used by the protocol for management and signaling.

---

### 4.3 Control Frames

Control frames are used for signaling and connection maintenance between endpoints.
At present, FFP defines one control message type:

- **Ping (Type 0x3):**
  Used to measure latency or verify connection health. The payload is a up-to 16-bit unsigned integer indicating the ping sequence or payload size.

Upon receipt of a **Ping** frame, the endpoint **MUST** respond with a **Pong** frame containing an identical payload. This allows the sender to compute round-trip time (RTT).

Future control messages may be defined via IANA extension or protocol revisions.

---

## 5. Message Handling

When a frame is received, the endpoint **MUST**:

1. Validate the frame length against the declared `Length` field.
2. Identify the frame type via the `Opcode`.
3. Process the payload according to its type:
   - **Text Frame:** Decode the payload as UTF-8 and pass the resulting text to the application layer.
   - **Binary Frame:** Forward the payload to the application layer as opaque data.
   - **Control Frame:** Execute the relevant control logic (e.g., respond to `Ping` with `Pong`).

When sending data, the sender **MUST** construct a properly formatted frame by setting the `Opcode`, calculating the `Length`, and appending the payload.

---

## 6. Error Handling

Endpoints **SHOULD** close the connection upon detecting malformed frames, invalid lengths, or unrecognized opcodes.
Implementations **MAY** implement rate limiting or timeout mechanisms to mitigate abuse or flooding.

---

## 7. Security Considerations

FFP does not provide built-in encryption, authentication, or integrity verification.
For confidentiality and integrity, implementations **SHOULD** operate FFP over a secure transport such as **TLS**.

Applications using FFP **MUST** validate all incoming data and handle malformed frames gracefully to prevent buffer overflows, denial-of-service attacks, or resource exhaustion.

---

## 8. IANA Considerations

No IANA actions are required at this time.
Future versions of FFP may define registries for frame opcodes, control types, or protocol extensions.
